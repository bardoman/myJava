base package for interfacing with a library system. <br>
All library related classes used in general throughout the product should come from<br>
this package or the userinterface subpackage to this package. &nbsp;The actual library <br>
specific packages which will implement library calls should go in subpackages to this<br>
package. &nbsp;Here is a guide to how to decide what to put in this package and what to put<br>
in library specific packages:<br>
When writing library related code, no package outside of com.ibm.sdwb.build390.library.cmvc<br>
should EVER have any library specific code in it.&nbsp; Everything outside of that package should use<br>
generic library classes that come from com.ibm.sdwb.build390.library or <br>
com.ibm.sdwb.build390.library.userinterface.&nbsp; There is one and only one exception.&nbsp; In the Setup<br>
GUI, there is a Library -&gt; Add menu.&nbsp; A single line can be added to the class for this that instantiates<br>
a CMVC or Clearcase Library info object depending on what the user selects.&nbsp; That one line of code,<br>
creating a new library specific object, should be the only library specific code outside of the CMVC <br>
(or whatever) package.&nbsp; This means that when implementing support for a new library, you just have<br>
to build the library specific package.&nbsp; WIth the addition of the single line to the setup dialog, you will<br>
be ready to go. Also, this will insure that when fixing a bug, if it's library specfic it will get fixed in the<br>
library specific package and so will have no way to screw the other library.&nbsp; In otherwords, fixing a<br>
clearcase bug you CANNOT break CMVC.&nbsp; Also, if the bug is not library specific the code should<br>
not be in the library specific section.&nbsp; So when you fix it for clearcase you WILL fix it for CMVC.&nbsp; As<br>
this shows, we have a simple guideline we need to use when deciding what to implement at the library<br>
specific level and what at the generic library level.&nbsp; The answer is everything that can be done at library<br>
generic, should be.&nbsp; Nothing that's library specific should be though.<br>
An example: <br>
I'm working on requisite checking code that forms the scary backbone of
the usermod and PTF processes.&nbsp; I am going to write library
specific code that will get the base requisites in their simplest
forms, convert them to a common data class, and pass the processing
back to the generic code to actually process the requisites and find
the necessary groupings for processing.<br>
