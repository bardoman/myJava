<p>Build/390 automates the building and packaging of S/390 software products stored
in the CMVC library system. Build/390 uses existing S/390 build and packaging
tools with minimal changes.</p>
<p>Build/390 consists of a remote client, an MVS server, <span>an RMI server,</span> and a set of tools and processes invoked by the server to process product
parts. Build/390 provides a Java client, which runs on Windows platforms, and a
UNIX System Services (USS) command line client. The server is an MVS started
task that communicates with the client via TCP/IP sockets and can initiate
up to 100 simultaneous sub-server jobs to process client requests.</p>
<p>Build/390 provides the following benefits over traditional methods of building
and servicing products:  </p>
<ul>
<li>A platform-independent Java client</li>
<li>An automated process which eliminates numerous manual and tedious steps</li>
<li>The ability to restart a build at any phase in the process</li>
<li>Error information from the workstation client which eliminates the need
to log on to OS/390</li>
<li>The ability to save detailed information about builds which enables you
to recreate builds quickly and easily</li>
<li>The orders and profiles used by Build/390 can be versioned in the CMVC library
with the product code.</li></ul>
<p>The client accepts input from the Java client graphical user interface
(GUI) or from the USS client command line. You can start a build using the
Java GUI dialogs or by entering build instructions on the USS command line.
Once all required input information is verified, the client starts a series
of build phases that are defined in the BLDORDER order stored in the source
library. The client tracks each phase and if any jobs are submitted on the
server, it waits until they have all been completed. If all jobs complete
successfully, the client starts the next phase. This process continues until
all of the predefined phases have been completed. The phases do things such
as process macros, compile parts, and link edit.</p>
<p>The build process is completely configurable and can consist of an arbitrary
number of phases. For example, a two phase process could consist first of
processing all macros by placing them in macro libraries and second of processing
all other parts, including all of the modules to be compiled. Any given driver
can use any of a number of different build types that specify different phase
processing. For example, a final build type may include packaging phases,
whereas a development build type would not. The build types and phases are
defined in a BLDORDER that is versioned in the library along with other types
of orders and source parts.</p>

<a name="header_21"></a>
<h2 id="header_21"><a href="#ToC_9">Connection requirements</a></h2>
<p>Ensure that you have TCP/IP installed and a connection
to the IBM network.</p>
<a name="header_22"></a>
<h2 id="header_22"><a href="#ToC_10">Minimum hardware requirements for Windows users</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>128MB RAM</li>
<li>256MB Virtual Memory (paging space)</li>
<li>333 MHz Pentium III or equivalent processor</li></ul>
<a name="header_23"></a>
<h2 id="header_23"><a href="#ToC_11">Build/390 client options</a></h2>
<p>You can run Build/390 commands using the Build/390 client graphical user interface
(GUI) or by executing commands from a UNIX System Services (USS) command line.</p>
<a name="header_24"></a>
<h3 id="header_24"><a href="#ToC_12">Build/390 client GUI</a></h3>
<p>The Build/390 client GUI for Version 5.0 runs on Windows platforms only. Windows
95, 98, NT, 2000, and XP are supported. Windows NT, 2000, and XP are recommended.</p>
<p>If you use Windows 95, you may experience problems when running a large
build (tens of thousands of parts). Windows 95 does not manage memory well
which can result in crashes during a large build. It is important to reboot
your Windows system at regular intervals, especially before performing large
builds.</p>
<a name="hdrusscl"></a>
<h3 id="hdrusscl"><a href="#ToC_13">USS command line client</a></h3>
<p>Build/390 provides command line support for the USS environment.</p>
<a name="header_29"></a>
<h4 id="header_29"><a href="#ToC_14">BPXPRM00 settings</a></h4>
<p>Parmlib member BPXPRM00 contains customization values for USS. The following
settings can affect the USS client and may need to be adjusted by your system
administrator:  </p>
<ul>
<li>MAXASSIZE: Limits the amount of storage available to the client. A setting
of 500M is usually adequate.</li>
<li>MAXCPUTIME: Sets the process time limit. It is recommended that this be
set to unlimited which is MAXCPUTIME(2147483647).</li></ul>
<a name="header_30"></a>
<h4 id="header_30"><a href="#ToC_15">Build/390 client running in INPUT mode</a></h4>
<p>When running the USS client, you may experience a situation where the client
keeps going into INPUT mode. If this occurs, you must periodically press Enter
to keep the client running. Your local system administrator should be able
to fix this problem.</p>
<p>For instructions, refer your system administrator to Appendix D, &quot;Staying
in Running Mode&quot; in the document,<cite> Porting Applications to the OpenEdition MVS Platform</cite> at <a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/GG244473.html">http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/GG244473.html</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hdrcmvcc"><a href="#ToC_16">CMVC requirements and recommendations</a></h2>
<a name="header_32"></a>
<h3 id="header_32"><a href="#ToC_17">Before you begin</a></h3>
<p><span>Before using</span> the Build/390 client, ensure that your system
administrator has completed all CMVC requirements described in the <cite>Build/390 RMI Server Administrator Guide</cite> at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm</a>. Failure
to complete these requirements can result in unsuccessful builds or builds
which contain the wrong parts.</p>
<a name="hdrcmvcp"></a>
<h3 id="hdrcmvcp"><a href="#ToC_18">Required CMVC permissions</a></h3>
<p>The following CMVC permissions are required to perform the associated Build/390 task:
 </p>
<dl>
<dt class="bold">Permission</dt>
<dd class="bold">Build/390 Task</dd>
<dt class="bold">S390Config</dt>

<a name="hdrprpe3"></a>
<h3 id="hdrprpe3"><a href="#ToC_19">Optional part rename pre-exit</a></h3>
<p>If you use the default LODORDER shipped by Build/390, the Part Rename pre-exit
protects you from altering the Build/390 part name. The Build/390 part name is the portion
of the file path after the last forward slash and before the first dot.</p>
<a name="wq2"></a>
<div class="notetitle" id="wq2">Note:</div>
<div class="notebody">If you change the default load order shipped with Build/390 and
use a different method to determine the Build/390 part name, the Part Rename pre-exit
will not work properly. For example, the MVS server may (depending on the
LODORDER) recognize the renamed part as a new part.</div>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: The default LODORDER shipped by Build/390 uses
several parameters as input. One parameter is the CMVC part name, for example,<tt class="xph"> dir1/dir2/jaker.asm</tt>. When the Build/390 LODORDER parses the CMVC part name,
it looks for the last forward slash character, then parses the remaining character
string into two fields:  </p>
<dl class="parml">
<dt class="bold">PARTNAME</dt>
<dd>contains the character string after the last forward slash and to the
left of the dot. In this example, PARTNAME is <tt class="xph">jaker</tt>.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">REST</dt>
<dd>contains everything to the right of the dot. In this example, REST is <tt class="xph">asm</tt>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this example, the Part Rename pre-exit restricts you from renaming the
PARTNAME <tt class="xph">jaker</tt>. You can rename those parts of the file path <span>before</span> the last forward slash (<tt class="xph">dir1/dir2</tt>) and <span>after</span> the dot (<tt class="xph">asm</tt>).</p>

<h3 id="header_36"><a href="#ToC_21">CMVC and BPS</a></h3>
<p>This book describes the Build/390 client's role in the service process. To
use the Build/390 Service process, you also need to be familiar with CMVC and
BPS. For CMVC information, refer to the CMVC InfoCenter at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/cmvc/5.0/infocenter/">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/cmvc/5.0/infocenter/</a>.

<a name="header_37"></a>
<h3 id="header_37"><a href="#ToC_22">Concurrent development support</a></h3>
<p>The Build/390 service process supports CMVC Concurrent Development mode.</p>
<p>Note that Build/390 has disabled the CMVC <tt class="xph">Conflict accept</tt> option.
If you try to use this option and conflict records exist for the Track, Build/390 will
require that you return the Track to the Fix state without saving your changes.</p>
<p>For more information on Build/390 concurrent development support and conflict
resolution, refer to <a href="#hdrcdmode">Concurrent development service processing</a>.</p>
<a name="header_38"></a>
<h3 id="header_38"><a href="#ToC_23">PassTicket support</a></h3>
<p>The service process requires that your administrator set up PassTicket
support on the MVS host system. For more information, refer to the <cite>Build/390 RMI Server Administrator Guide</cite> at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm</a>.</p>
<a name="hdrresap"></a>
<h3 id="hdrresap"><a href="#ToC_24">APAR part restrictions</a></h3>
<p><span>By using an optional exit program,</span> Build/390 limits the contents
of a CMVC APAR defect on a RETAIN release (FMID) boundary. An optional Build/390 setting
allows you to limit the contents of an APAR defect to the RETAIN component
of the APAR.</p>
<p>For more information on the optional RESTRICTCHECKINBYDEFECTCOMPONENT setting,
see the <cite>Build/390 RMI Server Administrator Guide</cite> at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm</a>.</p>

<h3 id="header_40"><a href="#ToC_25">PTF build and force supersede processing</a></h3>
<p>If you are using the force supersede option when building a PTF, see the
notes in the ++PTF process section of <a href="#hdrptf">Running a ++PTF build</a>.</p>
<a name="hdrcontps"></a>
<h3 id="hdrcontps"><a href="#ToC_26">PTF testing</a></h3>
<p>During the PTF test phase, a service builder may want to send a PTF to
Test for verification and install testing. For instructions, see <a href="#hdrrdfad">Retrieving data from a driver</a>.</p>
<p>The service builder can use CMVC environment lists to customize notification
of PTF test readiness. For example, it is possible to configure CMVC with
a unique tester for each environment associated with a particular release.
When the PTF build completes, the PTF level is set to CERTIFY, the test records
are set to READY, and CMVC sends an email notification to each tester of
record for all associated environment lists.</p>

<div class="notetitle" id="s1xb390in2">Note:</div>
<div class="notebody">Build/390 will automatically add an environment
called <tt class="xph">B390Internal</tt>. <strong>Do not take any action on
this internal test record.</strong> Build/390 automatically sets this record to abstain
when all other test records are processed (accepted or abstained.) For an
example, see the <cite>Build/390 service process example</cite> at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/s390_service_process_example.html">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/B390ServiceProcessExample50.html</a>.</div>
<p>An Environment List is a CMVC option used to specify environments in
which a release should be tested and the users who have access to those environments.
It includes a list of environment/user ID pairs that indicate users who can
test the environment. A test record is issued to each user, and all <span>user</span> test records must be accepted before the PTF ships. For more information

<a name="header_54"></a>
<h2 id="header_54"><a href="#ToC_28">Before you begin</a></h2>
<p>The Build/390 client needs setup information that defines how to communicate
with the Build/390 server and the CMVC library server. For the service process,
you must set up a connection to the BPS server.</p>
<p>In addition, Build/390 needs information that enables it to run jobs on OS/390.
The build processes use the setup information that was in effect when the
build page was opened. If you open a new driver build and then change the
setup information, those changes will not take effect until you close the
driver build and open a new one.</p>
<p>Before using the ZIP function in the Build/390 client, you must authenticate
with the RTPGSA firewall. Refer to the following URL for complete information: <a href="http://pokgsa.ibm.com/projects/g/gsa_architecture/public/firewall/RTPGSA%20Access%20Steps.html">http://pokgsa.ibm.com/projects/g/gsa_architecture/public/firewall/RTPGSA%20Access%20Steps.html</a></p>

<a name="hdrguibef"></a>
<h2 id="hdrguibef"><a href="#ToC_40">Before you begin</a></h2>
<p>You can run Build/390 commands using the Build/390 client graphical user interface
(GUI) or by executing commands from a UNIX System Services (USS) command line.
This chapter describes how to use the GUI. For instructions on
using the USS command line client, see <a href="#hdrcmdln">Chapter 5. Using the Build/390 command line clients</a>.</p>
<a name="hdrguistr"></a>
<h2 id="hdrguistr"><a href="#ToC_41">Starting the Build/390 GUI</a></h2>
<p>Before running the Build/390 GUI, you must make the directory where the client
was installed the current directory.</p>
<p>To start the GUI, run:  <tt class="xph">build390.bat</tt> <span> You can only
run one instance of the Build/390 client for each installation directory.</span></p>
<p>When the GUI starts, a window displaying Java information opens. Normally
you can ignore this window, but if you get an error, information about the
error is displayed in this window.</p>
<p>Once the GUI is open, you can select the process you want to run from the <strong>File</strong> or <strong>Tools</strong> menu. <span>These
processes are discussed in later chapters of this guide.</span></p>
<p>Most fields on the various dialogs include a List or Refresh button that
provides you with a list of valid entries for that field.</p>
<a name="sptdsfltr"></a>
<p id="sptdsfltr">There is a filtering option for many of the dropdown lists.
To filter the contents of a dropdown list:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Move your mouse pointer over the list entry field and click the right
mouse button to popup the filter menu.</li>
<li>Move the mouse pointer over the 'Filter' selection and click the
left mouse button. The filter dialog will pop up.</li>
<li>To find entries that match the filter entry field  
<ul>
<li>Enter '*' in the entry field to specify that ALL contents of the
list be shown.</li>
<li>Embed an '*' at any point within the word to indicate a single
character wild card.</li>
<li>Embed an '*' at the end of the word to match on any number of
trailing characters.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>When you first start the client, the client determines whether the last
build process executed was completed or not. If not, the GUI displays information
about the incomplete build and prompts you to restart it. If you choose to
restart the build, the client displays a list of phases that were previously
run. You can then select which phase to use to restart the build. For details,
refer to <a href="#hdrrestart">Restarting a build</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hdrguiopt"><a href="#ToC_42">Build/390 GUI Options menu settings</a></h2>
<p>The Options menu item on the main Build/390 window contains settings that affect
the operation of the client. <span>The first setting is for Setup; see <a href="#hdrsetup">Chapter 3. Setup and customization</a> for complete information.</span></p>
<a name="header_71"></a>

<a name="header_72"></a>
<h3 id="header_72"><a href="#ToC_44">Debug</a></h3>
<p>Turn debug on to cause the Build/390 client to pause before each step of the
build process. Before each step of the process, the client will display information
about that step. Once the step completes, you will be shown the results and
then information about the next step to be run.</p>
<p>Debug information is kept in the<tt class="xph"> \misc</tt> directory in the<tt class="xph"> Build390.log</tt> file.</p>
<a name="header_73"></a>
<h3 id="header_73"><a href="#ToC_45">Hold output on host</a></h3>
<p>Select this option to cause job output that is normally deleted automatically
to be saved in the output queue on MVS. This does not affect jobs such as
compiles (which are controlled by options on the build page) but does affect
jobs created as a result of operation of the client, such as a job to get
a status report for a driver.</p>

<a id="spttvcalls" name="spttvcalls"></a>
<h3 id="hdrtvcalls"><a href="#ToC_46">Trace verb calls</a></h3>
<p>This option causes Build/390 verbs to be traced. The client builds verbs
based on user actions, sends them to OS/390, and calls Build/390 to run them.</p>
<a name="wq10"></a>
<div class="notetitle" id="wq10">Note:</div>
<div class="notebody">When you trace a verb, the server returns thousands of records
of data to the client. The trace output is not readable to anyone that is
not trained in Build/390 verbs. Therefore, this option is used only when working
with Build/390 development to debug a problem.</div>
<p>This option remains active for one verb call only because the data returned
is not in a format that the client can reliably parse for results. To trace
a call:  </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Turn on debug and run up to the point where the verb you want traced is
about to be run.</li>
<li id="spttmodes">
<a name="spttmodes"></a>Select the trace option.  
<p>Possible trace modes are:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Verb only - To display only verb operations</li>
<li>Verb and data - To display both verb operations and output data generated
by the verbs</li></ul></li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> on the Debug window.</li></ol>
<p>After performing a trace on a given verb call, the client parsers will
not be able to handle the result data. This means that the client will be
unable to properly determine the results of the verb call. After a trace,
the build should be terminated. The build may then be restarted at a point
prior to the traced call to complete the build.</p>
<a name="header_75"></a>
<h3 id="header_75"><a href="#ToC_47">Standard error</a></h3>

<p>Some command line parameter names supported in the Build/390 4.0 client
are no longer shown in the help text. These parameters are still supported,
however equivalent aliases are now supplied. The 4.0 command <tt class="xph">DELETEDRIVER</tt> no longer supports the deletion of releases.  It is replaced by the

<h3 id="header_99"><a href="#ToC_71">Client GUI</a></h3>
<p><strong>To create a release</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>On the main client window, select <strong>Tools > Manage Releases/Drivers</strong>.</li>
<li>From the Manage Releases/Drivers window, select <strong>Actions
> Create > Release</strong>.</li>
<li>In the New Release window, fill in the required fields and click <strong>OK</strong>.  
<dl>
<dt class="bold">Library Release Name</dt>
<dd>Enter the name of the CMVC release as it exists in the library, case
sensitive.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">High Level Index</dt>
<dd>Specify the high-level qualifier of the data set names for all VSAM
data sets that will be created.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">S/390 Release Name</dt>
<dd>Enter the name you want to use for the new S/390 shadow release. The
value you enter will be converted to uppercase and is limited to 8 characters.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Additional Collectors</dt>
<dd>Specify the number of additional collectors that you may require in
addition to the supplied Build/390 collectors (SRC, SYM, OBJ, LST). These
additional collectors will be defined in every driver created for the release.
You cannot add or delete collectors once the shadow database is created and
one or more drivers has been created.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Additional Process Steps</dt>
<dd>Specify the number of additional processes steps that are required by
one or more of the build processes being used for the release. Fields are
allocated in the UNIMODC database to contain the parameter fields and processor
level identifier for the processor step. By default, UNIMODC contains areas
for two processor steps called APARM and CPARM. Steps only need to be specified
in this option if a build process has more then two steps that need customized
parm fields.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">DASD Volume Serial</dt>
<dd>Specify the volume serial identifier of the direct access storage device
on which the new data sets are to be allocated. Depending on SMS usage at
your site, you may be able to leave this field blank or to use a special character
(such as '*') to indicate that SMS is to choose an appropriate volume.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">SMS Storage Class</dt>
<dd>This field contains a valid value for an SMS storage class defined at
your site. If you enter a valid storage class name, leave the volume serial
field blank to permit SMS to choose an appropriate volume.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">SMS Management Class</dt>
<dd>Specify a valid value for an SMS management class defined at your site.
This field is valid only if you enter a value for the SMS storage class. To
use the default management class for the storage class you have chosen, leave
this field blank.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Unibank Primary Space</dt>
<dd>Specify a value for the number of cylinders of space to allocate to
the primary extent of the data portion of the VSAM cluster that will contain
the new Unibank data set. Make sure this allocation is adequate as a UNIBANK
data set cannot go into secondary extents. When creating a new full base driver
or a delta driver that contains all (or almost all) of the parts in the product,
we recommend that you specify 3 cylinders for this option. <span>For
large products such as DB2, IMS, and DFSMS, we recommend that you specify
10 cylinders for this option.</span>
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Bulk Primary Space</dt>
<dd>Specify a value for the number of cylinders of space to allocate to
the primary extent of the data portion of the VSAM cluster that will contain
the new bulk data set. Keep in mind that bulk data sets can expand to secondary
extents and that VSAM data sets can have over 100 extents.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Bulk Secondary Space</dt>
<dd>Specify a value for the number of cylinders of space to allocate to
each secondary extent of the data portion of the VSAM cluster that will contain
the new bulk data set. Secondary extents are allocated only as needed, and
VSAM data sets can accommodate over 100 extents.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Bulk Max Size</dt>
<dd>Controls the maximum number of cylinders that will be allocated to a
bulk log data set. When this cylinder count is exceeded, Build/390 will automatically
allocate a new bulk data set.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Bulk Max Extents</dt>
<dd>Controls the maximum number of extents allowed for a bulk data set.
When this extent count is exceeded, Build/390 will automatically allocate
a new bulk data set.

<h3 id="header_124"><a href="#ToC_99">Overview</a></h3>
<p>A driver build allows you to build a driver using one or more parts that
are stored in CMVC. Driver builds use library queries based on user input
to determine the list of parts to be built. Parts that are not already up-to-date
on OS/390 are then uploaded to the shadow release on OS/390. Metadata that has
been set for parts or tracks in CMVC will be used based on your configuration
settings. For more information, see <a href="#hdrconfig">Updating configuration data</a>.</p>
<p>The build instructions selected by the user are then run. Prior to running
a driver build, the release and driver to be built must have been created
on the OS/390 system.</p>
<a name="header_125"></a>
<h3 id="header_125"><a href="#ToC_100">Build phases</a></h3>
<p>The process of building a driver includes all the steps needed to produce
a desired package, including part selection, part extract, part upload, compiles,
link edits, etc. For a description of the build process and how to specify
what each phase does, see the <cite>Build/390 Process Reference</cite> at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm</a>.</p>
<p>The client controls driver builds by communicating with the development
library and the build server. Before starting a build, you must specify option
settings and criteria that you want to use to select the list of parts to
build. A Driver build executes the following phases:  </p>
<dl>
<dt class="bold"><a id="sptphases" name="sptphases"></a>Driver Report</dt>
<dd>Determine if driver is available for build.
</dd>
<dt class="bold"><a id="sptplist" name="sptplist"></a>Partlist</dt>
<dd>Determine list of parts to be built via library queries.  
<p>As of release
2.4, the partlist generation is done sending a request to the Build/390 RMI
server on the CMVC system. All queries are performed from that machine and
the resulting list is returned to the Build/390 client. This method improves
performance significantly for large products.</p>

<p>For the parts to be FTPed to OS/390 in the correct format,
they must have been loaded into CMVC properly. Ascii parts must have been
loaded as Ascii and the proper codepage must have been used and defined to
Build/390. See <a href="#sptcodepg">Code Page Support</a> for more information.
Binary parts must have been loaded as and be marked as binary. The LODORDER
that you use must properly define how all parts are to be loaded into the
shadow. One exception to this is that parts marked as binary in CMVC will
be loaded as binary regardless of the LODORDER definition.</p>

<dt class="bold"><a id="sptcodepg" name="sptcodepg"></a>Code Page Support</dt>
<dd>As part of the query process to build the part list, the Build/390 client
will obtain the contents of the "Codepage" field in CMVC for every part
and pass that value to the Build/390 server as part of the 'Check Parts'
process. The server will then consult a site specific table (#CODPAG) to determine
the appropriate FTP site command to be used when transferring this file. This
command will be passed back to the client as part of the shadow check report.
When the client ftp's the part to OS/390, it will ensure that the site
command specified is used for that part. Note that there is no way to make
use of this value if the part has been shadowed into a DFS hierarchical file
system. The USS DFS client uses the same translation table for all parts and
it cannot easily be changed.

<h2 id="hdrub"><a href="#ToC_109">User build</a></h2>
<p>A user build allows you to build a driver using one or more parts that
reside on your local workstation or in a PDS on OS/390. The library is not
queried for part names or levels, as is done for a driver build. Local parts
are uploaded to OS/390 (if not previously uploaded), then the user-selected
build instructions are run.</p>
<a name="hdrubbyb"></a>
<h3 id="hdrubbyb"><a href="#ToC_110">Before you begin</a></h3>
<p>Before running a user build:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The release and driver to be built must exist on the OS/390 system.</li>
<li><span>If you are using the Fast Track option,</span> all parts in
the user build must have previously been built into the driver or a base of
the specified driver. <span>However, if a Model part that was already
built is specified, the Fast Track part does not have to be previously built.</span></li></ul>
<p>The FastTrack option instructs the client to perform a quick compile of
the parts selected, then terminate. This option bypasses a number of phases
and results in no updates to the driver. For a FastTrack build, the driver
must have previously been built. <span>This is so that the ftp characteristics
of parts to be uploaded can be determined, information about any models specified
can be found, and output libraries can be allocated, such as driver maclibs.</span></p>
<p>Typically, you would select a Delta Driver as the target for a user build
since the primary purpose for user builds is quick turnaround for compiles
of updated parts on the workstation, and the user does not want any interactions
with other parts in the product. For more information on Delta Drivers, see
the <cite>Build/390 Process Reference</cite> at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm</a>.</p>

part upload, compiles, link edits, etc.</p>
<p>For more information on the build process and how to specify what each

<p>Any errors that occur are displayed in a message box. If an OS/390 job (such
as a compile) fails, a dialog is displayed which shows the name of the job
that failed, the part and version that is associated with the job, and the
return code of the job. The dialog also has buttons that allow you to view
error data from OS/390.</p>
<p>For detailed information on a build, review the <tt class="xph">Build390.log</tt> file
in the <tt class="xph">misc</tt> directory.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the User Build fails with a message that
the LODORDER ignored your part or the part could not be found in the release,
verify that you specified the correct directory structure in <a href="#sptubtip">LODORDER</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hdrusermod"><a href="#ToC_119">USERMOD builds</a></h2>
<p>You build a USERMOD to update a driver as part of the development process. <span>The MVS Administrator must manage the access to development base drivers
intended for USERMOD operations.</span> For more information, <span>refer
to the appendix for system administrators in the </span><cite>Build/390 Process Reference</cite> at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm</a>.</p>
<p>USERMODs can also be built using the ++APAR Build process. <span>For more information, see <a href="#hdraparb">Running a ++APAR build</a>.</span></p>
<p>USERMODs can be built from one of the following sources:  </p>
<ul>
<li>A level containing one or more tracks. The level is processed in the manner
described below.</li>
<li>A single track build. As long as the track has no unsatisfied requirements,
it will be built into a USERMOD using the same steps (except partitioning)
as a full level build.</li></ul>
<p>There are two ways to allow a USERMOD with no shippable parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>For an individual product, add EMPTYUM=YES=G to the GLOBAL section of
the product BLDORDER.</li>
<li>For a site default, set EMPTYUM=YES=G in #ILOCAL2.</li></ul><p class="indatacontent">For more information about allowing a USERMOD with no shippable parts,
refer to the <cite>Build/390 Process Reference</cite> at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm</a>.</p>
<p>The USERMOD process is configurable. Your Build/390 administrator will set up
the CONFIG data on a release basis. See <a href="#hdrconfig">Updating configuration data</a> for
more information.</p>
<p>Once you select tracks to build into USERMODs, the dependencies between
these tracks (prerequisite and co-requisite relationships) are analyzed and
the tracks are broken into groups as small as possible, unless the build single
USERMOD option is selected, in which case all tracks are built into a single
USERMOD, as long as their requirements are met. In this mode, an error in
any track will prevent the entire USERMOD from being built.</p>
<p>Beginning with Version 5.0, <span>when the track or level
contains parts which are shipped in multiple FMIDs, a separate USERMOD is
built for each FMID</span>. However, if you specify HOLD data or IF-REQs, the
same HOLD data and IF-REQs are added to each USERMOD. You cannot apply this
data to a specific FMID.</p>
<p>Library dependencies fall into three categories:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implicit prereqs</strong>  
<p>These are automatically created
by the library when a file is updated. For example, file A, version 1 is in
track 1. If you later update file A, and put it in track 2, as version 2,
then track 1 will be an implicit prereq of it.</p></li>
<li><strong>Explicit prereqs</strong>  
<p>This is where a developer has
told the library a given track is required before another one can be built.
An example of this case is if someone changed file B and checked it into track
3. Someone else was working on file C and checked it into track 4. For C to
work correctly, the version of B in track 3 was required. The developer working
on file C in track 4 would make track 3 an explicit prereq of track 4 to ensure
the right version of B would be available when his version of C was being
built.</p></li>
<li><strong>Coreqs</strong>
<p>These can be set explicitly or
implicitly.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information about library prerequisites and corequisites,
refer to the CMVC InfoCenter at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/cmvc/5.0/infocenter/">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/cmvc/5.0/infocenter/</a>.</p>
<p>Using these dependencies, the tracks are broken into groups as small as
possible. This allows as many USERMODs as possible to be built, despite failures
in the build stage. If all were built into one monolithic USERMOD, an error
in a single module would prevent the USERMOD from being built. This way, errors
in a track only affect that track and others that depend on it. Other tracks
with no dependencies on the bad track can still be built.</p>
<a name="wq63"></a>
<div class="notelisttitle" id="wq63">Notes:</div>
<ol type="1">
<li>The build type chosen for the USERMOD process should NOT package a USERMOD
using smodbld, because this is done by the client. The phases in the build
type are used for running the delta build to prepare the driver for packaging,
but NOT to actually package them.</li>
<li>The names of the tracks being built must conform to SMP/E standards. SMP/E
requires that any USERMOD name including any co-req or pre-req names be 7
characters long, the first being an alphabetic character and the remainder
either alphabetic or numeric. All alphabetic characters must be upper case.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt class="bold">SUPs</dt>
<dd>Build/390 automatically adds a SUP for each TRACK in the USERMOD. It does
not SUP previous USERMODs even if they contain the same set of files. There
is no facility to manually add SUP entries.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">PREs</dt>
<dd>To ensure USERMODs are installed in the correct order, Build/390 automatically
adds a PRE for the last USERMOD built for each file in this USERMOD. For example,
a USERMOD is being built for a track which contains files A and B. Previously,
file A was shipped in USERMODs UA00001 and UA00003, and file B was shipped
in USERMODs UA00004 and UA00008. So, this usermod will have a PRE for usermods
UA00003 and UA00008, the last USERMOD for each file. Note: These prereqs are
in addition to any explicit library prereqs specified by the user.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once the process completes, there will be a new set of drivers on OS/390 and
levels in the library holding the USERMODs that have just been built. <span>The levels holding the USERMODs are in commit state.</span></p>

<h3 id="wq82"><a href="#ToC_123">Troubleshooting USERMOD builds</a></h3>
<p>Any build errors that occur are displayed in a message box. If the OS/390 job
(such as a compile) fails, a dialog is displayed which shows the name of the
job that failed, the part and version that is associated with the job, and
the return code of the job. The dialog also has buttons that allow you to
view error data from OS/390.  For detailed information on a build, review the <tt class="xph">Build390.log</tt> file in the <tt class="xph">misc</tt> directory.</p>
<p>When a part fails a build phase, the Build/390 client sends an email note to
the last person who changed the part. This is the default Build/390 setting. To
enable Build/390 to find the last person who changed the part, the part must be
defined using a process that incorporates the track subprocess. If Build/390 cannot
determine the last person who changed the part and the release is configured
with Build Failure Notification turned on, a message is displayed indicating
that an error occurred when Build/390 attempted to find this information. This is
an informational message; no user action is required.</p>
<p>Optionally, a note can be sent to the owner of the part in addition to
the last person to change the part. Both of these note functions are controlled
by the administrator using the Build/390 Configuration and Administration Tool.
For additional information, refer to the Build/390 RMI Server Administrator Guide at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/b390doc50/documents50.htm</a>.</p>
<p>If a part cannot be associated with an email address in CMVC, Build/390 warns
the builder that the owner of the part should be notified of the failure.
For more information, see Updating configuration data<a href="#hdrconfig">Updating configuration data</a>.</p>
<p>For additional troubleshooting hints and tips, see <a href="#hdrerrors">Chapter 10. Troubleshooting and Help</a>.</p>
<p>There are three possible results from the usermod build:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The build was successful; the usermod driver has been merged; the usermod
has been stored and/or transmitted as requested.  Once the process completes,
there will be a new set of drivers on OS/390 and levels in the library holding
the USERMODs that have just been built. The levels holding the USERMODs are
in commit state.</li>
<li>The build was successful but merge failed. The usermod undo process is
skipped when a merge failure occurs. This is to avoid leaving the base driver
in inconsistent state.</li>
<li>The build failed during the building of a USERMOD; the level and driver
created by the USERMOD process are deleted. Unbuilt tracks are left unassigned.</li></ul>
<a name="wq83"></a>
<h4 id="wq83"><a href="#ToC_124">Merge failure</a></h4>
<p>The following corrective actions are required if there is a merge failure.
The usermod undo process is skipped when a merge failure occurs. This is to
avoid leaving the base driver in an inconsistent state. The Build/390 administrator
must correct and manually merge the driver, and the library administrator
must commit the appropriate usermod level once the manual merge is completed.</p>

<a name="hdrservp"></a>
<h3 id="hdrservp"><a href="#ToC_126">Overview</a></h3>
<p>Build/390 provides facilities to produce ++APARs and ++PTFs. This process involves
the Build/390 client and server, CMVC, CMVC user exits, and BPS. BPS polls Retain
and opens defects in CMVC when an APAR is created. Using Build/390, CMVC, user
exits and BPS, an APAR/PTF can be taken through the service process with RETAIN
automatically updated as the APAR/PTF progresses.</p>
<p>This section describes the Build/390 client's role in the service process.
To use these processes you should be familiar with CMVC and BPS as well
as Build/390.</p>
<a name="hdrerrhan"></a>
<h3 id="hdrerrhan"><a href="#ToC_127">Error handling in library exit-driven operations</a></h3>
<p>The configuration option, MVSOUTPUTINERRORMAIL, can be used to indicate
whether error message(s) for user exit failures will be included in the email
message which notifies people that the build has failed.</p>
<p>By default, no error messages are included in the email message (<tt class="xph">false</tt>). Set MVSOUTPUTINERRORMAIL to<tt class="xph"> true</tt> to include error
messages(s).</p>
<p>The type of failure determines who is notified:  </p>
<ul>
<li>For a track-related failure (fix, review, integrate), the defect owner
for the defect the track was created against is notified.</li>
<li>For a level-related failure (going to commit or complete, post PTF actions),
the level owner is notified.</li>
<li>For a test record failure, the owner of the test record is notified.</li></ul>
<a name="hdrcdmode"></a>
<h3 id="hdrcdmode"><a href="#ToC_128">Concurrent development service processing</a></h3>
<p>The Build/390 service process supports CMVC Concurrent Development mode. In
concurrent development, a part can be checked out to more than one track at
the same time. Concurrent development does not allow more than one user to
check out a part to the same track at the same time.</p>
<a name="header_151"></a>
<h4 id="header_151"><a href="#ToC_129">Conflict accept option</a></h4>
<p>Build/390 has disabled the <tt class="xph">Conflict accept</tt> option. If you try to use
this option and conflict records exist for the Track, Build/390 will require that
you return the Track to the Fix state without saving your changes. If this
occurs, Build/390 issues the following messages:  </p>
<pre class="xmp">   In service releases, Build/390 disables the conflict accept option.
   To remove the conflict, return track &lt;track_name> to the Fix state
   and undo any changes to part &lt;part_file_path>. For more information
   on conflict resolution, see the Concurrent Development section
   of the Build/390 Client User Guide.</pre>
<a name="header_152"></a>
<h4 id="header_152"><a href="#ToC_130">Conflict resolution</a></h4>
<p>CMVC allows the first user to change a Track for a common part to Integrate. CMVC checks
for conflicts when subsequent users attempt to change a Track for the common
part to Integrate state. If CMVC detects a conflict, the user is notified
and must reconcile the conflict before the Track can move to Integrate state.</p>
<a name="header_153"></a>
<h4 id="header_153"><a href="#ToC_131">Example</a></h4>
<p>In this example, User1 is working on APAR1/Track1/Part2. At the
same time, User2 is working on APAR2/Track2/Part2. User1 finishes first and
promotes Track1 to Review state. After this occurs, User2 attempts to promote
Track2 to Review state. During this process, CMVC detects a conflict in
Part2 and rejects User2's Track review. User1 and User2 must resolve the
conflict before CMVC will move Track2 to Review state.</p>
<p>For more information on how CMVC handles conflict resolution, refer to
the <cite>CMVC InfoCenter</cite> at <a href="http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/cmvc/5.0/infocenter/">http://w3.sdwb.ibm.com/cmvc/5.0/infocenter/</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hdraparb"><a href="#ToC_132">Running a ++APAR build</a></h3>
<p>This process is used to build and package corrective fixes for a single
SMP/E APAR. The user is required to create and build an OS/390 delta driver
for the APAR prior to proceeding with this process. For information about
these procedures, refer to <a href="#hdrcad">Creating a driver</a> and <a href="#hdrdb">Driver build</a>. The Build/390 client controls this process by communicating with the
Build Server, PDT, BPS, and the Development Library.</p>
<p>Before starting a build, the user must specify the Defect and Release.</p>
<dl>
<dt class="bold">Defect</dt>
<dd>A defect name
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Release</dt>
<dd>A release in the Development Library
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When the user specifies a Defect name, the List button next to the Release
field will be enabled. This button sends a query command to the development
library for a list of releases that contain the defect entered. The release
can then be set from the results of that query.</p>
<p>You can restrict the list of Development Library paths and components to
get parts from by setting restrictions. See <a href="#sptres">Restrictions</a> for
detail.</p>
<a name="sptaprusrm"></a>
<p id="sptaprusrm">You
can use this process to build a ++USERMOD. To do so, select the 'Build
Usermod' checkbox on the ++APAR build dialog. You can optionally specify
a USERMOD name. The name must be 7 characters starting with 2 alphabetic characters
followed by 5 numerics. If you do not specify a name, one will be generated
for you.</p>
<p>When using this process to build a ++USERMOD, no updates are made to PDT

<ol type="a">
<li>If no unfrozen dependent (PRE or SUP) PTFs, use COPYSENT as the base.</li>
<li>If there are one or more unfrozen dependent (PRE or SUP) PTFs, use the
list from PDT (in the order they were defined). Build/390 will then base the PTF
driver either on COPYSENT or the list of dependent drivers in the order given.</li></ol></li></ol>

<p>The PTF Requisite Definer enables you to select PTFs as a group and define
requisite information for all of them. Once defined, the Build/390 client packages
the PTFs as a single group. This is especially helpful for PTFs that include
more than 2000 parts or include parts that are extremely large. In both of
these cases, the PTF must be split into multiple PTFs that require each other.
Using the PTF Requisite Definer, this task is no longer an unwieldy one.</p>

<h3 id="hdrrestart"><a href="#ToC_146">Restarting a build</a></h3>
<p>You can restart a previously run build at any phase in the process. When
a previously run build is loaded, the client displays a list of the phases
that have been run and lets you restart the build at any one of them. You
can also select to continue where the previous build left off. You also have
the option of selecting a phase and displaying its results. If you restart
at the extract phase or the part upload phase, you can choose whether to process
all parts or start where a previous attempt failed.</p>
<p>This provides the user with flexibility in dealing with a failed or incomplete
build. It means that the builder does not have to start from the beginning
every time something goes wrong. However, you do need to pick a phase to restart
that makes sense when considering what has changed since the previous attempt.
For example, if a build failed because a part included in the build did not
compile correctly, and you fixed the problem by checking the part out of the
library, changing it, and checking it back in, you will need to restart at
the phase that queries the library for the list of parts to build so that
the new version of the part will be used.</p>
<p>If you restart at the Extract and Upload phase, you are presented with
the following options:  </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Restart from the beginning - extract and upload all the parts that need
to be updated on OS/390 regardless of what happened in the previous run of
the build. Use this option if one or more parts were uploaded incorrectly
in the previous run of this build and you want to extract and upload them
again.</li>
<li>Start at the point where the previous attempt failed - Extract and upload
only those files that were not successfully done before the previous run of
the build terminated. Select this option if the previous build failed because
tcpip or ftp went down and some of the files did not get uploaded.</li></ol>
<p>If you restart at a host phase, normal operation is for the client to restart
the build at the phase selected and continue through the build. However, you
can instruct the client to verify the results of the prior attempt of the
phase selected by checking the <strong>'Check results of previous
execution of phase'</strong> check box. If you do, the client will request
status from the MVS server for the phase selected, and if the previous attempt
was successful, the build will continue at the next phase. If the previous
attempt was not successful, the build will stop and display error information.</p>
<p><strong>To restart a build</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>On the main client window, select <strong>Tools > Manage Processes</strong>.</li>
<li>On the Process Management Frame window, select the build you want to work
with. Then select <strong>File > Load</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>When a build is started, the driver being built is locked. No other build
process can update that driver until it is unlocked. The <span>driver
is unlocked</span> when the build completes successfully <span>or when
you run the cleanup process. Once</span> the driver is unlocked, it can be locked
and run through another build leaving it in a state not understood by the
first build. Therefore, once the driver is unlocked from a particular build,
that build cannot be restarted.</p>

<a name="hdrmdtyp"></a>
<h2 id="hdrmdtyp"><a href="#ToC_150">Part metadata</a></h2>
<p>The Build/390 client allows you to manage metadata at the part
level.  Part metadata can be set for a single part and is saved in CMVC tables.
This data is associated with a single part and is versioned just as parts
are. Metadata is carried over from one version of a part to the next. If the
metadata for a part is changed, that part will be rebuilt the next time it
is included in a build.</p>
<p>To set Part metadata, you must have FileModify authority for the part.</p>
<p>When a driver build is started, the Build/390 client will query CMVC for
CONFIG information that determines if the part metadata is to be used in the
build process. If the processes are turned on in the CONFIG information, the
client performs queries to obtain any metadata set for each of the parts to
be built. The client will then include these settings (for each part to be
built) when building the verb that is used to update the metadata in the UNIMODC.</p>
<a name="sptmdhlist"></a>
<p id="sptmdhlist">Build/390 enforces a hierarchy of metadata for the various types
and orders. Metadata is defined in the following order:  </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>OP=UPD statements</li>
<li>Local section of the BLDORDER</li>
<li>Part profile</li>
<li>Related metadata part</li>
<li>CMVC part metadata (via Metadata editor)</li>
<li>Embedded part metadata</li></ol>
<p>If any of the levels past the Profile level define a new profile, then
that new profile is executed at the time it is defined.</p>
<p>Embedded Metadata is the last set to be applied and cannot be overridden.</p>
<p>To enable the use of part metadata, your Build/390 client CONFIG information
must be set properly. This data is set by your Build/390 administrator on a release
basis. Contact your Build/390 administrator for more information. The metadata edit
menu items are disabled unless the CONFIG data includes the correct settings.</p>
<a name="hdrmetadcd"></a>
<h2 id="hdrmetadcd"><a href="#ToC_151">Metadata updates in a concurrent development release</a></h2>
<p>When using part metadata in a release that has concurrent development turned
on, all virtual versions of a part in the release (versions that start with <strong>v</strong>) will have the same copy of metadata.</p>
<p>For example, User1 has Part1 in Track1, and User2 has Part1 in Track2.
As long as changes in Track1 and Track2 are virtual, both User1 and User2
will see changes to the metadata when either makes a change. Once the part
is given a real version number, it is no longer updated when User1 or User2
updates the metadata for it.</p>
<a name="hdrmetadem"></a>

<p>The Metadata Editor provides the ability to view and alter the current

editor are validated against a set of rules on OS/390 and any errors are displayed.
Once all metadata passes the validity check, the changes are saved to metadata
tables in CMVC. <span>You must have S390Metadata permission within
CMVC to update metadata.</span> <span>Unassigned tracks in fix state are

using the LODORDER, BLDORDER, part profiles, or related metadata parts as
they currently exist in the driver. That is, if a user is running the Metadata
Editor for a track and the track includes new or updated versions of LODORDER,
BLDORDER, etc., METAEDFT will not use them when making the "best guess" for
the other parts. No filtering takes place based on "best guess" for compiler
and assembler parms set in #CPARM and #APARM or other local verbs used by
locally written sotypes.</li>

<li>Related Metadata Part</li>
<li>Embedded</li>

<p>To enable editing fields that have already been embedded in a parts source,
select <strong>Options > Edit embedded fields</strong>. A warning is
displayed advising you that any embedded values you override here will not
be used unless you remove them from the parts source.</p>
<p>The edit dialog is organized by field type. If you resize the dialog, the
fields will be repositioned as needed. Each field is preceded by a box which
is used to indicate to the editor that you want to save the data for this
field in the CMVC metadata tables.</p>
<p>To modify a field, check the box to the left of the field to enable that
field and then change the data as needed. For example, to change a switch
field setting, check the box to the left of the field (to enable the field)
and set the box to the right of the field name (to set the switch setting).
For multiple entry fields, right click in the data field to bring up a pop-up
menu that allows you to add, remove, edit, and reposition data.  </p>

and SYSLIB must all have the same number of values. The nth value in each
field defines a shippable for the part. DISTNAME is also part of the group,
but a single entry is permitted, and in that case it is used for all entries.
If an entry for a member of the group must be null, enter a value of <tt class="xph">*NONE*</tt>. For example, you have three PARTTYPE entries and only the first
and third have a SHPALIAS. Set the second SHPALIAS value to <tt class="xph">*NONE*</tt>.</div>

The validation request will be submitted. Once validation is successful, the
data will be saved to CMVC. To validate the changes without saving the metadata,
select <strong>Check</strong>.</p>
<p> If you previously added a setting to the metadata for a part and want
to remove it, you have two choices:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Null out the value for the field in the Metadata Editor. To do so, leave
the field checked in the editor and blank out the value previously specified.</li>
<li>Uncheck the field in the editor, which will cause the field's value to
be set to a value from a higher level of metadata (if one exists) the next
time the part gets built. If you just uncheck a previously defined field in
the editor and that field is not set anywhere else but in the CMVC table,
then that value will not be undefined in any driver where it already exists.
To get rid of a field value that is set only in a CMVC table, you must use
the first option.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Filter based on metadata in CMVC only. This option filters the matching
metadata of parts that exist in CMVC.</li>
<li>Filter based on metadata on the host only. This option filters the matching
metadata of parts that exist on the host.</li>
<li>Filter based on metadata both in CMVC and on the host. This option filters
the matching metadata of parts that exist in CMVC and on the host. The full
set of regular expressions is supported for this option. (Refer to <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info">http://www.regular-expressions.info</a> for
more information.)</li></ul>
<p>A replace option enables you to find metadata and overlay it with new values.
There are two options for replacing data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace metadata in CMVC. This option replaces matching CMVC values of
parts existing in CMVC only. The match is based on the criteria you enter.</li>
<li>Replace host and CMVC metadata in CMVC. This option replaces matching
CMVC and host values of parts in CMVC only. The match is based on the criteria
you enter, and the match of metadata must exist both on the host and in CMVC.
No changes are made to the parts on the host. The full set of regular expressions
are supported. (Refer to <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info">http://www.regular-expressions.info</a> for more information.)</li></ul>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>: </p>
<pre class="xmp">SOTYPE EQ PLX - search for SOTYPE equals PLX 
Note that PLX is treated as string literal if regular expression is unchecked.
If Regular Expressions(Unix) is checked, then PLX is treated as a regular expression.
The following example strings match if PLX is a regular expression.
PLX, PLXD, APLX, ABCKAPLXD, APALXOPLX.
SOTYPE EQ P.* - search for SOTYPE equals P followed by anything 
Note that the dot matches any character, and the star allows the dot to be

the metadata. That includes CLASS &amp; MOD as set by the current LODORDER.</li>
<li>The best guess values are overridden by any CMVC metadata in the filter

<p>The Job Scheduler function provides a way to schedule jobs for execution
on OS/390 at regular intervals independently of client interaction. To bring
up the scheduler window, select the <strong>Tools > Scheduler</strong> &lt;serverid>
menu item. Click <strong>Refresh</strong> on the scheduler window to
get a list of all jobs currently held in the scheduler queue. Basic information
is displayed in table format to allow the user to choose the appropriate job
to work with. To view the details of a given job, select it in the table and
then select <strong>Jobs > Edit</strong> from the menu. This will pop
up the edit window showing all available information about the selected job.</p>
<p>There are 5 functions provided for manipulating the jobs. All but one (the
add function) require that a job be selected from the table.</p>
<dl>
<dt class="bold"><a id="sptschadd" name="sptschadd"></a>Add</dt>
<dd>This function allows the addition of a new job to the scheduler queue.
The keywords are  
<ul>
<li><strong>Group name (required)</strong>  
<p>This serves to partition
the different jobs, by username or whatever other criterion one wishes to
use.</p></li>
<li><strong>Event name (required)</strong>  
<p>A name for this individual
event. Should be descriptive.</p></li>
<li><strong>Interval (required)</strong>  
<p>00:00 means just run once
per days selected, otherwise, count as a delay between consecutive executions
of the job. 01:00 means every hour, 00:40 means every 40 minutes, etc.</p></li>
<li><strong>Start (required)</strong>  
<p>Determines the time of the
first execution during the day. 00:00 is midnight, 09:13 is 9:13, etc.</p></li>
<li><strong>Stop</strong>  
<p>Determines the time to stop scheduling
an event. Say start = 09:00, interval is 00:20, and stop time is 10:10. The
job will run at 9, 9:20, 9:40, and 10.</p></li>
<li><strong>Days to run (required)</strong>  
<p>Determines the days an
event is scheduled.</p></li>
<li><strong>Return code checking</strong>  
<p>If selected, after an execution
of the job the return code is checked. If it is greater than the value entered
here, a notification is sent to the contacts on the contact list.</p></li>
<li><strong>Step RC checking</strong>  
<p>If selected, after an execution
of the job, the return code of the given step name is checked. If it is greater
than the value entered here, a notification is sent to the contacts on the
contact list.</p></li>
<li><strong>DSN (required)</strong>  
<p>This points to the actual data
set name of the JCL file on OS/390 to run at the specified times. The JCL must
meet the following requirements:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The JCL must NOT contain either the USER= or PASSWORD= keywords.</li>
<li>The JCL may contain multiple steps, but no more than one JOB statement.</li>
<li>The owner of the server must have RACF read authority to the data set
specified for DSN.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Contact list (required if RC or Step RC checking selected)</strong>  
<p>This is a list of node.userid entries that receive a notification
when a job fails.</p></li></ul>
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Remove</dt>
<dd>Removes the selected job from the scheduler queue.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Edit</dt>
<dd>Edit works like ADD, but all fields start off filled in to the values
from the selected job. Also, group name and event name cannot be changed.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Reactivate</dt>
<dd>This can only be used on jobs that are scheduled but not currently active.
It sets them to the active state.
</dd>
<dt class="bold">Deactivate</dt>
<dd>This can only be used on jobs that are scheduled and are currently active.
It sets the state to inactive so the job will no longer be run. Inactive jobs
remain in the queue.

process which says that the APAR object does not exist.</p>
<p>This error can occur if the APAR build or setup object on the RMI server
is corrupted or deleted. The service process fails. To fix this situation:
 </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start the Build/390 client.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Tools > Manage Processes</strong> to find the build that was run from your client.</li>
<li>Select the build that relates to the failed APAR, then <strong>File > Copy</strong> the RMI object to the RMI server.</li></ol>

<h3 id="hdrcp12"><a href="#ToC_186">Metadata editor error about all lists containing the same number of
entries</a></h3>
<p>I am making Metadata changes using the metadata editor and get the following
error: All lists in the Related entry group must contain the same number of
entries.</p>
<p>This error occurs if you do not have the same number of entries in each
of the following fields: DISPLN, DISTLIB, DISTSRC, FCNS, PARTTYPE, SHPALIAS,
and SYSLIB.</p>
<p>The multiple entry fields DISPLN, DISTLIB, DISTSRC, FCNS, PARTTYPE, SHPALIAS,
and SYSLIB must all have the same number of values. The n'th value in
each field defines a shippable for the part. DISTNAME is also part of the
group, but a single entry is permitted and in that case it is used for all
entries.</p>

<p>Windows 95 does not manage memory well which can result in Windows 95 crashing
during a large build. If you are going to be running large builds on a windows
platform we recommend using Windows NT, Windows 2000, <span>or Windows
XP.</span></p>

<p>To integrate your local help panels with the Build/390 client help panels, update
your site specific links and information in the file <tt class="xph">./misc/SiteSpecificDocumentation.html</tt>. The client displays in its help browser under the topic <strong>Local site specific help</strong>. When a user selects that topic, the contents
of the file <tt class="xph">SiteSpecificDocumentation.html</tt> are displayed. An example
of how your help panel might appear follows.:</p>
