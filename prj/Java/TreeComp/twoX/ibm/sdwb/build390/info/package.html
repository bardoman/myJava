data classes that are used to pass information between different packages. <br>
Classes should only go here if they are used to store and transfer data between different packages.<br>
An information class that stored information about processes and nothing else should go in the process<br>
package. &nbsp;A class that stores information on files which is used in library classes and process classes<br>
should go here. &nbsp;This is not a horribly well defined package. &nbsp;In general, if you think something <br>
should go here, try to find a place it fits in better instead. &nbsp;Only if you can't do that put it<br>
here.
