parsers for mainframe verbs from the preprocessor. <br>
Parsers to convert the return reports from mainframese to more understandable<br>
Java classes that are easier to access. Right now there are parsers scattered in <br>
several different locations. &nbsp;They should gradually be moved here as time <br>
permits. &nbsp;Hopefully, someday (when the sun has exhausted it's fuel and <br>
expanded out to earth's orbit) the mainframe will use a standard encoding<br>
(such as XML) so that only one parser will be needed with different wrappers<br>
to access the encoded information.
