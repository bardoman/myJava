package for configuration classes. <br>

These are classes used to maintain configuration choices. &nbsp;Configuration switches should <br>

only be used for behaviour that is not intended to change on a regular basis and that only <br>

an administrator should be able to modify.. &nbsp;For example, if a given site likes to reuse PTF<br>

numbers when rebuilding PTFs, that is a site policy that would require the client to behave<br>

differently. &nbsp;Also, this is not something an individual user should be able to decide or change.<br>

Buildtype, on the other hand, could change every time you run a build. Also, every user <br>

could have a different buildtype they wish to use. &nbsp;So this should not be a configuration switch.
